## Pull Request Process

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
- Please make sure that all tests are passing, github pages renders nicely, and code coverage are are not lower than before your contribution. You see the different github action workflows by clicking the "Action" tab in the GitHub repository.
- We enforce a particular code style using pre-commit hooks. To ease the development process we encourage you to install these hooks. First make sure to install `pre-commit`, `python3 -m pip install pre-commit`, and then install the hooks using the command `pre-commit install` in the root of the repository. Whenever you create a new commit a set of tests will run to make sure that you are following the code style. The hooks will also try to automatically fix the issues whenever it can. You can read more about pre-commit at https://pre-commit.com.
